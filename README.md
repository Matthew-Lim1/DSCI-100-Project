# Predicting Newsletter Subscription from Minecraft Player Data
This project explores whether a player's age and in-game playtime can predict their likelihood of subscribing to a game-related newsletter. Using data collected from University of British Columbia's research group in Computer Science, led by Frank Wood, we apply preprocessing, visualization, and a k-Nearest Neighbors classification model to investigate behavioral patterns among players in R.

## Files Included

- `players.csv`" The dataset used for analysis

## Required R packages:
